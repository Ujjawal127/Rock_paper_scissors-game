## About the Game

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand:

- Rock (a fist)
- Paper (an open hand)
- Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)

The rules are straightforward:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

In this web-based version, you will play against the computer, and the winner is determined based on the classic rules.
